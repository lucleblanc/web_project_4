# Project 4: Around The U.S.

**Intro**

This is a project about sharing travel photos.  This is the first project that I have made that can be updated.  Click the edit button and change your name!



**Technologies**

For this project I expanded on my knowledge of CSS and HTML by making the site more mobile responsive, without the use of any frameworks.  I also added javascript for the first time, giving the site some functionality.

**Plans For Improvement**

My plan to improve the site is to continuously integrate new javascript features that I learn.
